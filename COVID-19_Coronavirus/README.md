# Resources on COVID-19 and Coronavirus

These record sets contain the bibliographic records of the 181 publications on COVID-19 and Coronavirus cataloged by GPO as of April 17th. Some of the records are brief bibs, or, preliminary records. Almost all of the records are for online versions of the resources.
