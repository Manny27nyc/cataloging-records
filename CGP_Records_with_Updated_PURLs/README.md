# CGP Records with Updated PURLs

A small number of depository libraries recently experienced problems with access to electronic resources within the Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP). GPO identified the source of the problem, which is related to the adoption of a new protocol called Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC).

The end result is that internet service or network providers that have adopted the DNSSEC will not resolve links whose websites are not configured for DNSSEC. This includes retired domains that are unable to validate and confirm what the security system is requiring.

GPO updated 191,129 PURLs in 170,501 CGP records. Some records do not contain OCLC numbers. There are 4 files each for UTF-8 and MARC-8. Each file is ~84 MB.

To download the files, use the "[Clone or download](https://github.com/usgpo/cataloging-records)" button. The downloaded zip file contains all of the files in the CGP on GitHub repository. Please watch the 3-minute tutorial, [Free Catalog Records through CGP on GitHub](https://www.fdlp.gov/free-catalog-records-through-cgp-on-github), on the Federal Depository Library Program website, [FDLP.gov](https://www.fdlp.gov).
