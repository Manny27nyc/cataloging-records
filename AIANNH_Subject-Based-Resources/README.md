# American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian (AIANNH) - Subject Based Resources

## Record Sets and .csv Files Based on LCSH Lists from Tribal College FDLs â€“ CGP on GitHub

-----------

The staff of several Tribal College Federal depository libraries (FDLs) requested GPO to test methods of providing notifications of newly cataloged online resources based on specific Library of Congress subject headings (LCSH). The FDLs worked with Library Technical Services staff to compile two lists of LCSH terms. In September 2019, we used those lists to search for new records added to the Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP) in the period of April through June 2019. The .csv files include major metadata fields, OCLC number, item number, SuDoc number, title, date, and PURL, for each publication.

The three lists of LCSH subject headings are:

- American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian terms
- Oil and gas drilling terms
- Water resources terms

For the terms of each list, please see the [description of the May 2020 files](https://github.com).

LSCM posts new files on a quarterly basis. The files consist of:

- MARC records in UTF-8, MARC-8, and MARCXML
- Comma-separated values (csv) files of the major metadata elements of the records, including hyperlinked CGP record numbers and hyperlinked PURLs, and Superintendent of Documents numbers.
- PDFs of the csv files.

The Tribal College FDLs and LSCM continue to collaborate and enhance these resources.
