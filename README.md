# Cataloging-records
The Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP) is the U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO) finding tool for electronic and print publications from the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the U.S. government. These publications make up the National Bibliography of U.S. Government Publications. CGP records contain descriptive information for historical and current publications and provides direct links to those that are available online. Records produced by GPO staff meet national standards such as Resource Description & Access (RDA) and Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (AACR2), and include GPO Historic Shelflist project brief bibliographic records and other retrospective records. 

The CGP on GitHub is a location where users may freely download record sets extracted from the CGP. Two file format options are available for record sets - MARC-8 and UTF-8.

## National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Collection
The entire NIST Collection contains nearly 10,000 records in 13 series/SuDoc stems. The NIST records were ingested into FDsys, now govinfo, in 2016. LSCM will release groups of records by monographic series and Superintedent of Documents classification (SuDoc) stems.

The records are also available in the Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP) and may be retrieved by this search in expert mode: `wlts=Nist-1`

The titles in the NIST Collection were published between 1903 and 2016. The documents cover a wide range of technical and scientific topics. LSCM staff reviewed and analyzed the records and enhanced the metadata through batch processes. In many of the records, NIST index terms in MARC 653 fields describe the content at a more granular level.
